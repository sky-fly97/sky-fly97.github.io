## Abstract

In the field of 3D point cloud object detection, the parameters of different lidar sensors are very different, therefore the training parameters of different models cannot be adapted. In addition, the large amount of unlabeled data also has an important role. We will work on semi-Ssupervised domain adaptation for 3D point cloud object detection.
