excerpt: "Semi-supervised few-shot learning aims to improve the model generalization ability by means of both limited labeled data and widely-available unlabeled data. Previous works attempt to model the relations between the few-shot labeled data and extra unlabeled data, by performing a label propagation or pseudo-labeling process using an episodic training strategy. However, the feature distribution represented by the pseudo-labeled data itself is coarse-grained, meaning that there might be a large distribution gap between the pseudo-labeled data and the real query data. To this end, we propose a sample-centric feature generation (SFG) approach for semi-supervised few-shot image classification. Specifically, the few-shot labeled samples from different classes are initially trained to predict pseudo-labels for the potential unlabeled samples. Next, a semi-supervised metagenerator is utilized to produce derivative features centering around each pseudo-labeled sample, enriching the intra-class feature diversity. Meanwhile, the sample-centric generation constrains the generated features to be compact and close to the pseudo-labeled sample, ensuring the inter-class feature discriminability. Further, a reliability assessment (RA) metric is developed to weaken the influence of generated outliers on model learning. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed feature generation approach on challenging one- and few-shot image classification benchmark"
